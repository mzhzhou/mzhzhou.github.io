                            With the growth and successes of large language models and machine learning, the integration
                            of technology into our lives will continue to expand at faster rates than ever. This has a
                            significant impact on students as AI models are introduced into education systems as early
                            as elementary or middle school, with few explanations of the risks or biases involved with
                            outputs. Even in the few circumstances where students are introduced to biases in AI models
                            early on, the explanations are often framed as a problem that is beyond their control.

                            While biases within trained models are not within easy student control, the way in which
                            information is interpreted by students is, and this contributes to how they critically
                            approach information interpretation.

                            Debi is an educational tool proposed from the frustrations of K-12 educators and their
                            interactions with AI, as well as literature on K-12 Education.

                            Educators felt a variety of feelings about the use of AI in their curriculum or by students
                            when completing homework. We found that they often felt a lack of confidence and general
                            confusion about how to implement or address AI in their classrooms. Additionally, they often
                            didn’t know how to explain to each other, or to their children that these tools are
                            inherently flawed and should not be copied. Drawing upon these insights, we felt it was
                            really important to have a way for students to learn and critically deconstruct various
                            types of models. For this project, we aimed to focus on Large Language Models in particular.

                            Early ideation was centered around a simple educational tool and idea: fridge magnets. We
                            wanted the tool to have a similar type of deconstruction and interactivity as standard
                            fridge magnets that children use to practice sentence-making. Inspired by this concept,
                            along with the incredible work by researchers of Scratch in the Lifelong Kindergarten lab
                            within Media Lab, of which this class was taught from within, Debi emerged as a drag-drop
                            tool with clear input and output features.
