                            This project was initiated from thinking about what it means to use space, and what spatial
                            interaction implies. How has our understanding and data collection of how humans use space
                            changed since the work of William H. Whyte, for example? While usability of projects are
                            able to be evaluated in fields such as HCI and industrial design, architecture is limited by
                            scale and costs, and thus these studies can only be done through simulations or through
                            post-occupancy studies from built precedents. In order to experience architecture, a person
                            needs to move around, navigate, and explore in order to obtain a complete impression. Thus,
                            movement becomes the primary way in which we interact with the built environment.

                            How might we measure this? One of the main complications with understanding how and what
                            people experience, is how highly subjective experiences can be. This project hypothesizes
                            that analysing human motion patterns would be an important contributor towards research in
                            understanding the usability and quality of spaces.

                            This study explores the systematic, quantitative analysis of motion in a given environment.
                            It attempts to taxonomize human body motion, presenting a framework that can be built upon
                            and layered to represent a wider context of determinants.

                            During the early 1900s, Lillian and Frank Gilbreth introduced ideas of motion economy
                            through using chronocyclegraphs, where small light bulbs where attached to the tips of
                            workerâ€™s fingers. In their studies, they revealed 18 types of elemental motions in the
                            industrial workplace which were eventually used to identify costly motion within
                            manufacturing and assembly. We drew inspiration from this framework as a starting point to
                            think about how movement can be broken down, in the absence of clear tasks.
