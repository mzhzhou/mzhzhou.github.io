                            communication, increased firefighting efficacy, and improved health and safety for field

                            Fire season is now on average 70 days longer than it was in the 1980s. The cost of wildfire
                            suppression has doubled over the last two decades due to climate change-induced droughts,
                            urban spread, and insect infestations. Wildfire teams are underfunded, with suppression
                            costs far outpacing budget increases, and municipalities are struggling to generate support
                            for necessary emergency services.

                            This is reflected in the gear and technology that is used for communication. As wildland
                            firefighters mostly work in remote locations, the lack of internet access severely limits
                            the availability of certain existing technologies. This makes communication and logistics
                            extremely slow, manual, and sparse. How might we help facilitate the efficiency and

                            field. However, budgetary constraints and the challenges of utilising existing technology in
                            remote areas have stifled any meaningful innovation to their tools for over thirty years.
                            Communication among crews, is provided through line-of-sight radios that broadcast changing
