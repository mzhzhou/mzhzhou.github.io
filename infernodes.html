                            The vicious cycle of homelessness is intensified by oral health
                            problems. Out of a survey of 250 homeless individuals, 70% of
                            individuals reported having lost teeth since losing a home, 27%
                            of those who have turned to drugs and alcohol to alleviate oral
                            pain. Oral health is woven into the fabric of daily life,
                            silently contributing to physical well-being, social confidence,
                            and mental health.

                            Oral health complications are currently strictly diagnosed and
                            treated in dental clinics. The stigma and financial barriers
                            associated with seeing dentists often prevent those most in need
                            from reaching help. For marginalized groups, this creates a
                            cycle of pain and fear towards dental problems.

                            Throughout the research stage of the project, we interviewed
                            dental practitioners, researchers, and users in order to gain
                            insight and obtain feedback. Through these interviews, our focus
                            area was refined to the problem of Caries. The chances of an
                            individual having Caries is incredibly high, with 9 out of 10
                            adults over the age of 20 having some degree of tooth-root
                            decay. This is a result of various factors but notably acid
                            erosion through diet. Caries currently can only be detected by a
                            dentist who uses a variety of techniques, of which pH measuring
                            is considered by many as a low-cost and effective diagnosis.

                            The process began with ideations of interventions. Each idea was
                            evaluated against technical feasibility and originality. Through
                            this process, we found portable technologies and affordable
                            paper-based technologies particularly promising because they
                            could help to fill the last-mile space between an individual and
                            a dental clinic. The testing phase consisted of exploring
                            different mediums of intervention and prototypes spanning from
                            paper to digital using material, form, chemicals and app usage.
