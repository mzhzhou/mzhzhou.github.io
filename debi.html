                            to get the design to a prototype stage. Mayuri built out the prototype in React and then

                            chains
                            that could be connected together. However, due to other moving pieces being defined, we
                            ultimately decided on building the first prototype with a draggable form as the
                            ‘magnet’.

                            struggle with the draggable feature, and it took a little bit of time until they
                            discovered
                            the
                            functionality. This told us that the shadow was not helping. A 'whiteboard' component was
                            explored to add a visual call to action. Here is one exploration of that idea.

                        <div class="project_process_text">Debi began as an explorative and slightly experimental
                            tool. As the tool was being envisioned, new papers, research, features, changes were
                            being made constantly. As we started planning the tool, features and problems became
                            more clear along the way. This manifested in the design through the parameter hierarchy,
                            shown below. In the beginning, while we were breaking down features of prompt
                            engineering, it seemed like all parameters would have equal importance, such as shown
                            below:

                            things. 1. Not all prompts are of equal importance. 2. LLM biases take time to uncover
                            when comparing within different tokens. These learnings manifested in 2 major feature
                            adjustments below.

                                The initial assumptions I had split prompts by components of sentences. Later designs

                                sentences and color was added to differentiate between the sentence purposes.
