                            of technology into our lives will continue to expand at faster rates than ever. This has a
                            significant impact on students as AI models are introduced into education systems as early
                            as elementary or middle school, with few explanations of the risks or biases involved with
                            outputs. Even in the few circumstances where students are introduced to biases in AI models
                            early on, the explanations are often framed as a problem that is beyond their control.

                            Educators felt a variety of feelings about the use of AI in their curriculum or by students
                            when completing homework. We found that they often felt a lack of confidence and general
                            confusion about how to implement or address AI in their classrooms.

                            insights, we felt it was
                            really important to have a way for students to learn and critically deconstruct various
                            types of models.

                            Early ideation was centered around a simple educational tool and idea: fridge magnets. We
                            wanted the tool to have a similar type of deconstruction and interactivity as standard
                            fridge magnets that children use to practice sentence-making. We were inspired by this
                            concept, along with the incredible work by researchers of Scratch in the Lifelong
                            Kindergarten lab within Media Lab, of which this class was taught from within.

                            users throughout. After synthesising the research findings, we completed 2-3 design sprints
                            to get the design to a prototype stage. Mayuri built out the prototype in React and then we
                            worked between Figma and React quite consistently. The below diagram shows our work process
                            over the weeks and provides some context for the challenges that will be discussed.

                        <div class="project_process_text">In our earliest designs, we wanted the components to feel more
                            like broken apart pieces of a puzzle, so the designs were initially thought to be like
                            chains
                            that could be connected together. However, due to other moving pieces being defined, we
                            ultimately decided on building the first prototype with a draggable form as the ‘magnet’.
                            This
                            is shown below.

                        <div class="project_process_text">After testing this prototype, we found that most users seemed
                            to
                            struggle with the draggable feature, and it took a little bit of time until they discovered
                            the
                            functionality. This told us that the shadow was not helping. During the redesigning process,
                            I
                            went back to the fridge magnets and thought about what indicated their draggability. It
                            seemed
                            that the presence of the whiteboard or a magnetic surface was an important component of this
                            interaction. Here is one exploration of that idea.

                        <div class="project_process_text">Ultimately, we decided that the magnet still allowed for more
                            interactivity and play. Instead of using the shadow feature solely to indicate draggability,
                            we
                            decided to change the input design to be loosely reminiscent of a whiteboard, with ‘ghost’
                            magnets to indicate the final destination. This turned out to work very well as users could
                            immediately better understand the interaction intent.

                            more clear along the way. This manifested in the design through the parameter hierarchy,
                            shown below. In the beginning, while we were breaking down features of prompt
                            engineering, it seemed like all parameters would have equal importance, such as shown

                                    initial
                                    assumptions that a user might make about interactivity at the beginning are very
                                    important. Key features need to be familiar enough to be easily usable, and
                                    adoptable
                                    with little friction.</li>
                                <li> When designing for a workshop format, the lesson plan is just as important as the
                                    functionality of the tool itself, and both need to be designed in conjunction.</li>
