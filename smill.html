                            The vicious cycle of homelessness is intensified by oral health
                            problems. Out of a survey of 250 homeless individuals, 70% of
                            individuals reported having lost teeth since losing a home, 27%
                            of those who have turned to drugs and alcohol to alleviate oral
                            pain. Oral health is woven into the fabric of daily life,
                            silently contributing to physical well-being, social confidence,
                            and mental health.

                            Oral health complications are currently strictly diagnosed and

                            associated with seeing dentists often prevent those most in need
                            from reaching help. For marginalized groups, this creates a
                            cycle of pain and fear towards dental problems.

                            Throughout the research stage of the project, we interviewed
                            dental practitioners, researchers, and users in order to gain
                            insight and obtain feedback. Through these interviews, our focus
                            area was refined to the problem of Caries. The chances of an
                            individual having Caries is incredibly high, with 9 out of 10
                            adults over the age of 20 having some degree of tooth-root
                            decay. This is a result of various factors but notably acid
                            erosion through diet. Caries currently can only be detected by a
                            dentist who uses a variety of techniques, of which pH measuring
                            is considered by many as a low-cost and effective diagnosis.

                            The process began with ideations of interventions. Each idea was
                            evaluated against technical feasibility and originality. Through
                            this process, we found portable technologies and affordable
                            paper-based technologies particularly promising because they
                            could help to fill the last-mile space between an individual and
                            a dental clinic. The testing phase consisted of exploring
                            different mediums of intervention and prototypes spanning from
                            paper to digital using material, form, chemicals and app usage.
                            Iterations were made based on feedback from professors, peers,
                            designers, scientists, and practitionors.

                            One of the foremost challenges was to find an intervention that
                            had higher likelihood of being adopted and sticking around in the
                            system. Any intervention would need to be cheap, low-tech, easily
                            usable, and adapt to the transient nature of moving from community
                            to community.

                            Paper-based assay tests were the optimal testing medium due to their
                            ability to detect for very specific conditions, and the low-cost to
                            manufacture. We conducted a number of studies to help us make broader
                            design decisions.

                            with the design development, was finding ways to integrate the technical
                            functionality into the design itself. This was particularly important for
                            getting the devices to work in conjunction with one another.

                            where one was more interested in gauging overall mouth health,

                            Smil is a kit of paper-based tests and point of care devices
                            that help to screen for various oral health diseases, namely
                            cavities or caries, outside of the dental clinic. The kit
                            consists of multiple parts: Single-use paper tests for the whole
                            mouth and individual teeth, 2 diagnosis readers, an endoscopic
                            camera, and a mobile application for communication with a
                            dentist clinic.

                                    There are alternative ways to look at systemic issues and to solve for them -
                                    beginning with the technology, or with the impact space. In this instance, we worked
                                    our way from both ends to find a fitting solution. It's important that these issues
                                    are not dropped due to the scale of complexity and difficulty of finding the right
                                    problem space.</li>
                                <li>Interface design goes beyond the design of the screen it was intended for, and into
                                    the design of the overall experience itself, ie. the product, branding, or even
